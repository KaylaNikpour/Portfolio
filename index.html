        <div class="bio">
     <p>I am a student currently studying Interactive design, UX. I like to create and design.  I enjoy reading, playing video games, 
        creating art, and exploring nature. I travel multiple times a year. I enjoy being away from home because the rest of the world 
        has so much to offer. I have a 2-year Masters Class certificate in acting. My dream is to be the lead in a major motion picture.</p>

     <p class="Favourites info"> I really enjoy reading different book series. I usually find that only reading a single book is dissapoint because 
        I always want to know more. This is why I have listed all series as my favourites! I got into video games in 2020 when Covid happened. Everyone
        had to stay home and I decided to try online games. Turns out I really enjoy playing games and have managed to meet many great people
        along the way. For travel, I have been very fortunate to have traveled quite often due to my mom and I have been able to experience a lot of color
        places over the years. My favourite was Costa Rica because not only is it absolutely beautiful, but the people and the culture are so pure. 
        For movies, I picked the 3 that I could watch on repeat for hours. I will stand by the Twilight series forever no matter what people say about it!</p>
