        <Main>
            <p>I am a student currently studying Interactive design, UX. I like to create and design.  I enjoy reading, playing video games, creating art, and exploring nature. I travel multiple times a year. I enjoy being away from home because the rest of the world has so much to offer. I have a 2-year Masters Class certificate in acting. My dream is to be the lead in a major motion picture.</p>
